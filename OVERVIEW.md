# dctools

A personal R package of tested helper functions for prediction- and
causal-inference research — the mechanics half of a two-repo system,
paired with the `biostat-support` skills marketplace (judgment).

## Goals

Give every home skill in the `biostat-support` marketplace a tested,
documented mechanic to call rather than a hand-rolled one-off.
`ROADMAP.md` lists planned functions grouped by analysis stage; each
group maps to a home skill (data-preparation, analysis-design,
statistical-critique, simulation-study, prediction-eval, …).

## Approach

Hard contract (see `CLAUDE.md`): `dctools` = mechanics — tested,
documented functions that *do* the repetitive work, with no opinion
about *when* to call them. Judgment — what to do, when, what to check,
red flags — lives in the marketplace’s skills, not here. Build order is
demand-driven, not roadmap order (decision 2026-07-04,
`memos/decisions.md`): ROADMAP sections 9-12 (the verification gates
that make agent-delegated analyses auditable) get built when a real
analysis or its home skill needs the gate.

## Structure

- `R/` — package source; exported functions are fully documented
  (roxygen + testthat).
- `tests/testthat/` — package tests; `devtools::check()` must pass
  clean.
- `man/` — roxygen-generated docs (committed, not hand-edited).
- `ROADMAP.md` — planned functions grouped by analysis stage, each with
  a home skill.
- `memos/decisions.md` — append-only decision log;
  `workflow-feedback.md` — tooling friction.

## Context & constraints

- **Tracker:** see biostat-support `docs/repo-clickup-map.md`. **Branch
  convention:** `CU-<taskid>-<slug>`.
- **PHI:** never in code, tests, examples, or fixtures.
- Package discipline is non-negotiable (see `CLAUDE.md`): ASCII-only R
  sources, fully qualified imports, `R CMD check --as-cran` clean,
  Air-formatted.

## Decisions

This repo’s decision log predates the OVERVIEW/STATUS scheme and stays
the canonical decision home — see `memos/decisions.md` (append-only,
newest first) rather than duplicating entries here.

## Pointers

- **Current status & next actions:** `STATUS.md`
- **Working conventions & guardrails:** `CLAUDE.md`
- **Decision log:** `memos/decisions.md` · **Tooling friction:**
  `workflow-feedback.md`
- **Planned functions:** `ROADMAP.md`
