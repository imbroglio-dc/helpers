# CLAUDE.md — dctools

This file guides Claude Code when working in this repository. `dctools` is a personal R
package of tested helper functions for prediction- and causal-inference research. The
repo and the package are both named **`dctools`**.

## Design philosophy (read before adding or changing functions) — IMPORTANT

`dctools` is **one half of a system**. The other half is the **biostat-support skills
marketplace** (a separate repo). The division of labor is a hard contract:

- **`dctools` = mechanics.** Tested, documented functions that *do* the repetitive work
  (intake QC, validation, diagnostics, scaffolding, formatting). No opinion about *when* to
  call them.
- **Skills = judgment.** What to do, when, what to check, red flags. That lives in the
  marketplace, not here.

**Therefore, when extending `dctools`:**

- Add a function only if it's a **reusable mechanic** with a **home skill** that will call
  it (or a clear place on `ROADMAP.md`). Don't add one-off, project-specific logic.
- Keep the *judgment/caveats* out of the function — a paragraph of "when/why" belongs in a
  skill or rule, not buried in roxygen. Roxygen documents *what it does*, not *when to use it*.
- If you find yourself wanting to hand-write a mechanic inside a skill or analysis, it
  belongs **here** instead.

`ROADMAP.md` lists planned functions grouped by analysis stage; each group maps to a home
skill (data-preparation, analysis-design, statistical-critique, simulation-study,
prediction-eval, …). Keep `ROADMAP.md` and the marketplace's
`docs/design-philosophy.md` in sync (that doc holds the full complementarity map).

**Build order is demand-driven, not roadmap order** (decision 2026-07-04, see
`memos/decisions.md`): ROADMAP sections 9-12 are the verification gates that make
agent-delegated analyses auditable — implement a function when a real analysis or its
home skill needs the gate. Cross-repo strategy: `biostat-support/docs/north-star.md`.
**Current focus, next actions, and progress live in `STATUS.md`** — refresh it
(`/update-status`) when they change; durable orientation lives in `OVERVIEW.md`. Tooling
friction goes to `workflow-feedback.md`, not the decision log.

## Package discipline (non-negotiable)

- **`DESCRIPTION`:** `Authors@R` only (no redundant `Author:`/`Maintainer:`); MIT license.
- **Exports:** every exported function has a roxygen block (`@param`, `@return`, `@export`)
  and a `testthat` test. Internal helpers are prefixed `.` and not exported.
- **Imports:** call imported functions **fully qualified** (`pkg::fn`) so `NAMESPACE` stays
  export-only. Keep `Imports` minimal; heavy/optional packages go in `Suggests` and are
  guarded with `requireNamespace()`.
- **ASCII-only R sources** (R CMD check `--as-cran` errors on non-ASCII; use `\uxxxx` or
  plain ASCII — no em-dashes/accents in `R/`).
- **After any roxygen/export change:** run `devtools::document()` (regenerates `man/` +
  `NAMESPACE`), then `devtools::test()` and `devtools::check()` — must pass clean. CI runs
  R-CMD-check + coverage + pkgdown and errors on warnings.
- **Format** with Air (`air format .`; config in `air.toml`).

## Conventions

- **Data manipulation:** `dplyr` surface grammar; `arrow`/`dbplyr` for large data (same
  verbs); `data.table` only for profiled hot paths.
- **Naming:** `snake_case` vars/columns; `verb_noun()` functions; `.dot_prefixed` internals.
- **PHI:** never in code, tests, examples, or fixtures.

## Build / test

```r
devtools::document()   # after roxygen changes — updates man/ + NAMESPACE
devtools::test()
devtools::check()      # must pass clean
```

`man/` is roxygen-generated; do not hand-edit (it is committed so CI can build).
