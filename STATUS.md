# dctools — status

**State:** active · **Updated:** 2026-09-03

## Current focus

Demand-driven build of the verification gates (ROADMAP sections 9-12):
implement a function when a real analysis or its home skill needs the
gate, not in roadmap order (decision 2026-07-04, `memos/decisions.md`).

## Next actions

Backfill the thin tests (`test-viz.R`, `test-packages.R`) when those
modules are next touched.

Build ROADMAP section 9-12 functions as home skills or real analyses
demand them.

Keep `ROADMAP.md` in sync with the marketplace’s
`docs/design-philosophy.md` complementarity map when either changes.

## Open questions / blockers

- None open.

## Recent progress

- 2026-09-03 — converted this repo’s status doc from `PROJECT.md` +
  `/project-status` to `OVERVIEW.md` + `STATUS.md` + `/update-status`,
  matching the canonical scheme the `biostat-support` router-composition
  design adopted ecosystem-wide; `scaffold.R` comments updated to say
  the `project-setup` skill (not an installed kernel) writes the router
  and traveling guard hooks, from the biostat plugin’s own
  `plugins/biostat/hooks/`.
- 2026-07-10 —
  [`clean_colnames()`](https://imbroglio-dc.github.io/dctools/reference/clean_colnames.md)
  refactored to wrap
  [`janitor::make_clean_names()`](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/make_clean_names.html)
  (janitor in Suggests, guarded); ROADMAP section 1 item closed;
  `check()` clean.
- 2026-07-04 — ROADMAP sections 9-12 reframed as delegation gates;
  demand-driven build order adopted (`memos/decisions.md`); `PROJECT.md`
  deployed as the status home.
